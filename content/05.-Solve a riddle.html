<h2>Solve a riddle</h2>
Please solve the following riddle and explain your solution: <br />
 <br />
 'I am an act, fueled by idea, action or movement: <br />
 I hold your attention in thrall, for utility or amusement. <br />
 Doodles by a child in the wet sand, <br />
 A vessel to achieve one small step for man;<br />
 The reason matters little: I need only your persistence,<br />
 Via any skill or medium you give my outcome existence.<br />
 My result can be living or inanimate, fleeting or forever,<br />
 each form grants you a title: mother, dancer.. inventor?<br />
 My greatest was a blast that could not be foreseen,<br />
 But my most famous depicted in a chapel kept pristine.'<br />
<br />
<br />
The answer to this riddle is "Creation."<br />
<br />
The first and second lines suggest that creation originates from an idea or action and has the ability to captivate an audience for either practical or entertainment purposes. The mention of "doodles by a child in the wet sand" and "a vessel to achieve one small step for man" suggest that the act of creation can take many forms and can be accomplished by anyone, regardless of skill level or resources available.<br />
<br />
The third and fourth lines emphasize that the reason behind creation is inconsequential as long as the person creating is persistent and passionate. The resulting creation can be animate or inanimate, temporary or permanent, and can give the creator a title such as mother, dancer, or inventor.<br />
<br />
The last two lines allude to two famous creations: one was a blast that could not be foreseen (possibly referencing the atomic bomb), while the other is depicted in a chapel kept pristine (possibly referencing Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling). Both creations demonstrate the enduring impact of human creativity and innovation.<br />
