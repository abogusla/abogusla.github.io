Working in a laser lab at Ottawa University is no easy task. With the power of light comes great responsibility, and the risk of losing an eye is ever-present. Fortunately, I have managed to remain unscathed through my many years of working in the lab. My colleagues and I are used to the dangers of laser light and take great care to make sure that everyone is safe. <br />
<br />
Despite the risk of potential eye loss, I have never been more excited to be in a lab. Every day is a new challenge, and I am constantly learning something new. I am particularly fascinated by the idea that humans could have eight eyes like spiders do. If we had eight eyes, we would still be able to see even after seven laser accidents. <br />
<br />
The thought of eight eyes is so fascinating to me that I have decided to take an Udemy class on openai. This class will help me to better understand the potential of artificial intelligence and robotic vision. I am also eager to learn how to create robots with the ability to see the world through eight eyes. <br />
<br />
In the end, I know that having eight eyes is only a dream, but it is a dream that I am determined to make a reality. By combining my passion for lasers with my enthusiasm for robotics, I hope to help make the world a better place. <br>
